# tozd/php

<https://gitlab.com/tozd/docker/php>

Image extending [tozd/nginx-cron](https://github.com/tozd/docker-nginx-cron) image to add [PHP](https://secure.php.net/)
and PHP FCGI daemon.

Different Docker tags provide different PHP versions.

If you are extending this image, you can add a script `/etc/service/php/run.initialization`
which will be run at a container startup, after the container is initialized, but before the
PHP FCGI daemon is run.
